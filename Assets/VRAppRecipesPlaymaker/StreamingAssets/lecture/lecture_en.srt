1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,168
Look at this! here I put in my hand between
this lamp and the wall. On the wall we can

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,129
see the shadow of my hand, you can also see
that the shadow is magnified compared to the

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:20,130
real size of my hand. This is a magnification
and this is the most fundamental microscope

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,379
that you can make right! If you put in lenses
and things that just makes it more of a compact

5
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:34,379
device but the principles is sort of like
this. Notice that no light passes through

6
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:41,729
my hand, we only se the shadow, one can say
that my hand fully absorbed light, and in

7
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,329
bright field microscopy that is the feature
you are looking for, absorption of light into

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,270
the sample and the more light it absorbs the
darker spots you get on the viewing screen.

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,270
Alright, now you probably know the most basic
things about light microscopy, welcome to

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,719
the first lecture in this materials characterization
course, in which we will talk about light

11
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:13,579
microscopy. It's good to get a good understanding
in light microscopy because it will help you

12
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,969
out in the further chapters of the course,
especially when we talk about electron microscopy

13
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:24,920
and especially transmission electron microscopy,
because most techniques in those are directly

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,019
comparable to light microscopy.

15
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,780
Welcome to the first lecture in light microscopy,

16
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,279
if you haven't checked the demonstration movie
on a light microscope I suggest you do that,

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,599
before you start viewing this lecture. The
sample preparation movies you can chose to

18
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,798
view afterwards if you like. The course book
starts with a section on geometrical optics,

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
I will leave that as an home exercise for
you to catch up on because I will not talk

20
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,349
about that in this lecture. What I do want
to talk about is dark-field and bright-field

21
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:07,739
imaging and if you take some fundamentals
about light interactions with the sample,

22
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,549
either it can be reflected, or absorbed in
the sample, or it can have a phase effect

23
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:20,079
on the wavelength of the light that passes
through. This is the two things that can happen

24
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:27,079
when light is lit upon the sample.
I will show you a detailed sketch about this,

25
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:34,698
first I draw a reference wave and that ray
passes through nothing so it has no effect

26
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:39,569
on anything, it just passing through. Then
I draw a second ray of light here that will

27
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,729
go through a sample that absorbs part of it,
when it goes through here part of it will

28
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,628
be absorbed and the amplitude of the wave
will therefore be smaller. The third ray,

29
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:55,679
I draw here, will pass through an object that
has a phase-effect on the wave, and that means

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,409
it will retard the wave and the phase of it,
so it will not come into sync with the other

31
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:08,558
waves. This can be for example a material
were you have different refractive indexes,

32
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:13,998
then you have effects like this. What you
can see here in these examples is that if

33
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:20,128
you have a bright field image in the microscope,
what you are looking for, the contrast in

34
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:27,128
the picture, will be depending completely
on absorption and that means that if your

35
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:34,198
sample is not absorbing so much compared to
the surroundings, then the image will be very

36
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,419
weak in contrast and it will be very hard
to see any details in it.

37
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:47,229
That's why you start using these phase techniques.
It's for example phase-contrast and differential

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,519
interference contrast, I will talk on that
in detail in the second lecture. At the moment

39
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,829
I think it's important to know that either
you have absorption or phase effects on the

40
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:07,109
waves.
In bright field imaging of the microscope,

41
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:12,650
what you do is that you collect all the transmitted
light that passes through the sample and all

42
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:19,000
the light that is not absorbed or reflected
in the sample. That gives you this classic

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,500
microscope image that you perhaps seen before
from undergraduate school. This technique

44
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:33,728
is good if the sample has high absorption
in its features, because then you will have

45
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:41,279
good contrast. The reverse side of this technique
is the dark-field imaging, in this technique

46
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,110
what you do then is instead of looking at
all transmitted, unaffected light, you cancel

47
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,908
out that light and only look at the light
that is reflected (scattered) in the sample. That gives

48
00:04:54,908 --> 00:05:01,800
you an image that looks inverse to the bright
field image. All the white parts will become

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,800
black in this case and the sample will appear
as it glows by itself when you look upon it.

50
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:17,289
The dark field image is also an advantage
when you have reflected light from the surface,

51
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,870
you know that light microscopes, you saw that
in the demo movie, we can booth have transmitted

52
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,899
light that goes through or you can have reflected
light from top as well. If you only use the

53
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:34,848
top reflected technique is very handy if you
look for example at metallic samples that

54
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:41,848
you have etched. In that case all the grains
will have chamfered edges due to the etching

55
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,000
and that will reflect light differently and
if you use dark field imaging on that you

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,389
will see the grains very clearly, a good technique
for that.

57
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:00,389
If I'm going to draw how this basically works,
then it is like this, there is a picture in

58
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:07,519
the book of this also and I think it's good.
I draw a side view of the microscope here,

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,129
and at the bottom I draw the condenser lens
with its aperture. Beneath I draw a top view

60
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
so you can see exactly how the aperture of
the condenser looks like. The aperture is

61
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,180
a round disc and in bright field imaging what
you keep is a hole that looks like this that

62
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:36,019
you can change the size of, that's the aperture
size. The aperture cancels out everything

63
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:41,979
that's outside the hole, light can only pass
through it. That is for bright field imaging.

64
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,418
In the middle I put in a glass slide with
the sample, and on top of that you have the

65
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:54,149
objective under the microscope that picks
up the light. What you can see here is that

66
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:59,778
when the light comes through the condenser
it will match up so all the light will be

67
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:06,778
transmitted through the sample and then will
be picked up by the matching objective here,

68
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:16,038
that gives you this transmitted bright field
image. Instead if you have, I draw that on

69
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,870
the other side, here to the right, the dark
field imaging case. What you do then is instead

70
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,870
of having this hole of the condenser aperture
you have a round disc in the center. You cancel

71
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:39,408
out all the light that's in the center, what
that means is that the light you shine upon

72
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:47,168
the sample will come in at a specific angle
into it. If the light is not affected by the

73
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,500
sample it will go out in the same direction.

74
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,640
The smart thing here in dark field imaging

75
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:05,739
is that if you have objective at top that
is built so that it matches this angle, and

76
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,028
if the light is unaffected and passes out
at same angle it will miss the objective and

77
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:18,028
will not be picked up. If that's the case
you will only see a black screen in the microscope

78
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:24,740
when viewing. Because all light has been canceled
out and goes outside of the objective. But

79
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,740
if the light is interacting in the sample
and changes angle, if it's refracted in the

80
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:41,250
sample then it will take a different angle
out from the sample and then some of it will

81
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:48,059
come into the objective and that means when
you look at the image it will actually look

82
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:55,059
like the sample itself is bright. Then you
get this reverse effect of bright field image.

83
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,509
The next thing you need to have a understanding
about is phase-plates. Phase plates were sort

84
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,948
of discovered by accident, I think it was
by Rayleigh, he poured out some acid on top

85
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:17,578
of glass slide and then he found out that
this etched down the glass very little, half

86
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:25,718
a wavelength of the light and that had this
kind of phase effect when he did some optical

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,559
investigation of it. A phase plate is this
glass slide that you 

88
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,459
have etched an annulus ring on top of. 

89
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:47,899
The smart thing with this,
that is if you take this phase plate glass

90
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,730
slide with this specific ring shaped structure
and then you create an equal aperture in the

91
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:02,299
condenser with the same annulus shape, this
is a development step from the dark-field

92
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:09,299
central stop aperture, here we have a specific
spacing around not just a central stopper.

93
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:17,278
If you do that then all the light that goes
through the sample and is unaffected will

94
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,299
have the same angle as in the dark-field imaging
mode, but you pick up that light with the

95
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:28,299
objective, you created a different objective
that can pick up that light as well. Then

96
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:34,789
that light, if you put this phase-plate on
top of the objective, that unaffected light

97
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:41,789
will go through this etched ring of this glass
slide, that we call the phase-plate. That

98
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:49,570
means that the wavelength will be shifted
half a wavelength compared to if it were refracted

99
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:56,708
in the sample. If the sample has a different
refractive index, then the angle out from

100
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,240
the sample by the light beam will be different
and that means that light when it hit the

101
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:14,049
phase-plale will not go through this etched
ring, only unaffected light that goes through

102
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,240
it, all other light will go somewhere else
on the phase-plate. That means that you will

103
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:31,828
have two waves that goes out on top of the
phase plate that will be retarded half a wavelength

104
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:40,039
from each other. What is the conclusion of
this, light that is interacting with the sample

105
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:52,409
will be shifted half a wavelength compared
to non-affected light, these two light rays

106
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:00,470
will interfere with each other and create
destructive interference and that gives you

107
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:09,458
this thing called phase contrast. Because
it is destructive interference you will have

108
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:18,919
a contrast feature were things will look bright
and dark depending on the refractive index

109
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,440
of the sample, so this gives the possibility
to view samples that has the same absorption

110
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:35,919
of light but different refractive indexes.
Typical examples is if you look at biological

111
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,480
objects a cell for example, living cells,
that has liquids and things inside it that

112
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:52,789
is transparent compared to the glass and the
water that you have perhaps have put around

113
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:59,458
it on the objective glass. If you put this
in under phase contrast technique then you

114
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:05,318
can see if there are different refractive
indexes of the cell and the surrounding water

115
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,610
and this will create contrast and you will
more easily see it compared to if you just

116
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:16,610
use bright field imaging. That is the natural
development step up from dark-field imaging.

117
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:26,458
That's phase contrast technique.
This is enough for lecture one, now I talked

118
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:35,079
about bright field imaging, dark-field imaging,
and a little bit about phase-contrast and

119
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:42,078
the phase plate. What I want You to do now
is to solve some of the problems as suggested

120
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:50,490
below and then you continue on lecture two.
In lecture two I will talk about differential

121
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,089
interference contrast and polarization techniques.
Alright, see you on lecture two.
