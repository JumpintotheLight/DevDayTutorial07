    a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide
    for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings
    of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution
    for the United States of America.\r\n\r\n<b>Article I (Article 1 - Legislative)\r</b>\nSection
    1\r\nAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the
    United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nSection
    2\r\n1: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every
    second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State
    shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch
    of the State Legislature.\r\n\r\n2: No Person shall be a Representative who shall
    not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen
    of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that
    State in which he shall be chosen.\r\n\r\n3: Representatives and direct Taxes
    shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this
    Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding
    to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term
    of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.2
    \ The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting
    of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten
    Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives
    shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least
    one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New
    Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island
    and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four,
    Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five,
    South Carolina five, and Georgia three.\r\n\r\n4: When vacancies happen in the
    Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs
    of Election to fill such Vacancies.\r\n\r\n5: The House of Representatives shall
    chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\r\n\r\nSection
    3\r\n1: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from
    each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof,3 for six Years; and each Senator
    shall have one Vote.\r\n\r\n2: Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence
    of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes.
    The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration
    of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year,
    and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third
    may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise,
    during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make
    temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall
    then fill such Vacancies.4\r\n\r\n3: No Person shall be a Senator who shall not
    have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the
    United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State
    for which he shall be chosen.\r\n\r\n4: The Vice President of the United States
    shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally
    divided.\r\n\r\n5: The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President
    pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the
    Office of President of the United States.\r\n\r\n6: The Senate shall have the
    sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall
    be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the
    Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence
    of two thirds of the Members present.\r\n\r\n7: Judgment in Cases of impeachment
    shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to
    hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but
    the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial,
    Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n1: The Times, Places
    and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed
    in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by
    Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\r\n\r\n2:
    The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall
    be on the first Monday in December,5 unless they shall by Law appoint a different
    Day.\r\n\r\nSection 5\r\n1: Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns
    and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute
    a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and
    may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner,
    and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\r\n\r\n2: Each House may determine
    the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and,
    with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\r\n\r\n3: Each House shall
    keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting
    such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of
    the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth
    of those Present, be entered on the Journal.\r\n\r\n4: Neither House, during the
    Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more
    than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall
    be sitting.\r\n\r\nSection 6\r\n1: The Senators and Representatives shall receive
    a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the
    Treasury of the United States.6 They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony
    and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at
    the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the
    same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned
    in any other Place.\r\n\r\n2: No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time
    for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority
    of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof
    shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under
    the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in
    Office.\r\n\r\nSection 7\r\n1: All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in
    the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments
    as on other Bills.\r\n\r\n2: Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives
    and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of
    the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return
    it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall
    enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.
    If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the
    Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which
    it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House,
    it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be
    determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against
    the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill
    shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after
    it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as
    if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return,
    in which Case it shall not be a Law.\r\n\r\n3: Every Order, Resolution, or Vote
    to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
    (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the
    United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him,
    or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and
    House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in
    the Case of a Bill.\r\n\r\nSection 8\r\n1: The Congress shall have Power To lay
